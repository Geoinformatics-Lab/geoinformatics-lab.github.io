<br>Geoinformatics encompasses the science and technology that deals with
the acquisition, storage, management, analysis and visualization of spatial
data. Spatial data are identified by their unique location (longitude,
latitude, elevation coordinate or an X, Y, Z spatial coordinates) with
information or attributes assigned to each location. Spatial data related
to earth and allied sciences are of dual nature namely spatial and attribute,
therefore Geoinformatics tools and technologies are useful in various&nbsp;
applications in this fields. One of the main advantages of digital datasets
is that they are easily amenable to computer handling. Once the spatial
data is integrated into a computer system, a wide variety of processing
and analytical tools can be used to extract relevant information and to
build computer models of objects, phenomena and processes on and in the
earth.&nbsp;
<p>In Geoinformatics, Remote Sensing (RS) plays a vital role in acquisition
of spatial data in the form of satellite images. Further, Geographic Information
Systems (GIS)&nbsp; and Database Management Systems offer a powerful environment
for managing, analyzing and visualization of the data. Lastly, recent advancement
in communication technology affords sharing and dissemination of spatial
information. Remote sensing, GIS and Internet Communication Technology
have be applied to several areas of research and development in earthsciences
namely, natural resource exploration, environmental assessment and monitoring,
hazard mapping and risk management and 3-D visualization.&nbsp;
