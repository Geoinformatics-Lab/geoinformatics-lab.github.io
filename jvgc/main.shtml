  <p align="left">Advent of the information age has made available a host of tools and 
technology for management, analysis and visualization of geo-scientific 
data. Developments in Geoinformatics have helped in gathering information 
and understanding various aspects of earth science such as resource exploration, 
natural hazard mitigation and environmental monitoring. Industrialized 
nations have a technological edge in the field of Geoinformatics. However, 
there is an urgent need for such technology in rapidly industrializing 
nations such as Vietnam. Sharing of appropriate, affordable and advanced 
technology for common benefit of mankind is a keystone of international 
scientific cooperation. Recognizing the need for such cooperation Geoinformatics 
it is desired to organize the "Japan-Vietnam Geoinfomatics Consortium". 
The Consortium is aimed towards researchers and engineers interested in 
the various aspects of Geoinformatics with particular emphasis to its application 
in Vietnam.</p>
