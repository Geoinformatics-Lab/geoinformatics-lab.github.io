###About AGILE###

The Association of GeoInformatics Laboratories for Earthsciences (AGILE) traces its origins to the Japan-Vietnam Geoinformatics Consortium (JVGC), which was established in 2002 to promote active scientific exchange on the prospects and challenges of emerging technological tools in Geoinformatics.

In response to growing interest and expanded support, the name Association of GeoInformatics Laboratories for Earthsciences (AGILE) was formally adopted by JVGC on August 1, 2024. AGILE was registered as a General Incorporated Association (一般社団法人) in Osaka, Japan, on January 16, 2025, to further its mission of promoting Geoinformatics technologies and fostering a vibrant community of practitioners, researchers, students, and other stakeholders in Asia and beyond.

AGILE aims to serve as a platform for academia, governments, businesses, and civil society to exchange ideas and knowledge on the application and utilization of Geoinformatics for societal benefit. To achieve this goal, AGILE aspires to function as a professional organization dedicated to advancing education, research, and international collaboration in Geoinformatics, encompassing the broad field of Earthsciences (*misspelling is intentional*).
