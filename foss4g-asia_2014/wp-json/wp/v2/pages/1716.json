PostgreSQL and pgpool-II were utilized to construct the system. PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database management system. Pgpool-II that has some modes for management of distributed database is a middleware for PostgreSQL. The prototype distributed database system for management and sharing of borehole data has been successfully implemented by using Replication mode and Parallel query mode of pgpool-II.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0Development of distributed database system for borehole data using free and open source software Presenter:\u00a0Tatsuya&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1716"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1716"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1716\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1942,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1716\/revisions\/1942"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1716"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
