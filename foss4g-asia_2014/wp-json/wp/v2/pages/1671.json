These information were filed and managed based on the position or the GPS points, then they were mashuped and displayed on the e-science platform of geographical science with the support of WebGIS technology, or were published as the REST service base which the users can do applicant development. E-science platform of geography developed \u201cField scientific exploration data file and management module\u201d to achieve the function of batch type-in, management and visualization displaying of filed point information. This module includes three parts: one is a customized Excel template, it can fill in the recorded information every day or every few days; another one is an network platform template information and the attached upload online system; the third one is a webgis based visualization platform of exploration information.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:Research and Practice for the visualization of scientific exploration information in Northeast Asia Transect based&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1671"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1671"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1671\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2139,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1671\/revisions\/2139"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1671"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
