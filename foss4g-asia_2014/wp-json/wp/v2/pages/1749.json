Activities must be documented, working hours need to be tracked. Whether local government or (small) businesses, on-site work is often managed in an old-fashioned and rather inefficient way. rnrnWith optimization of work processes and tour scheduling in mind we have started to build a task management software based on available open source software and open standards. In this presentation you will learn about our concepts, and how FOSS4G can facilitate on-site customer services and improve service quality and efficiency.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0Location-based Task Management for Mobile Business Presenter :\u00a0Daniel Kastl Type:\u00a0Oral Salesmen need to visit their&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1749"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1749"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1749\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1926,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1749\/revisions\/1926"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1749"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
