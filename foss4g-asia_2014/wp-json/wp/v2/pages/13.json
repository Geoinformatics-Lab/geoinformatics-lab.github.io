It will also\u00a0look into some of the work being done with a full weather station set of\u00a0sensors. An overview of OSHW communications will go through ftp upload and\u00a0SMS delivery of selected data. Finally integration with some common FOSS4G\u00a0will be experimented with: Python-OGR, pyGRASS, QGIS, PyWPS.<\/p>\n<h3>QGIS<\/h3>\n<p>Instructor: Sarawut Ninsawat<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Quantum GIS (QGIS) is a user friendly Open Source desktop application for working with a variety of spatial data. This workshop will introduce you to QGIS and look at not only its core features, but how it can interoperate with MapServer, GRASS, Web services, and PostGIS.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Development and application of Global Map data<\/h3>\n<p>Instructor:\u00a0Nobusuke Iwasaki<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Description: Global map is fundamental digital geospatial data which\u00a0cover whole land area and have been developed by each National\u00a0Geospatial Information Authorities (NGIAs). This workshop will\u00a0introduce how to develop Global Map data with GRASS GIS and\u00a0application for an evaluation of environmental degradation and\u00a0disaster with QGIS.<\/p>\n<h3>ZOO Project<\/h3>\n<p>Instructor:\u00a0Gerald Fenoy<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">The ZOO-Project provides a WPS (Web Processing Service) compliant and developer-friendly framework to easily create and connect OGC Web Services. During this workshop, participants will install the ZOO-Kernel and related material on their computers; upon installation the users will be ready to use and implement WPS 1.1.0 services<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>MapMint<\/h3>\n<p>Instructor:\u00a0Gerald Fenoy<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">Mapmint is an Internet platform dedicated to the management, processing and publication of geographic data. Based on a collection of C\/Python\/JavaScript open source geospatial software, MapMint combines and orchestrates various OGC and W3C services and provides a complete administration interface for the use of use MapServer, GDAL\/OGR and OpenLayers together online. The purpose of this hand-ons is to present MapMint and its main functions and step-by-step into the administration interface to particularly the automatic and visual creation of MapServer mapfiles (WYSIWYG) and the advanced configuration and publication of web mapping applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>FOSS4G routing with pgRouting, OpenStreetMap road data and OpenLayers 3<\/h3>\n<p>Instructor:\u00a0Daniel Kastl<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #222222;\">pgRouting adds routing functionality to PostGIS. This introductory workshop will show you how. It gives a practical example of how to use the new pgRouting release with OpenStreetMap road network data. It explains the steps to prepare the data, make routing queries, assign costs, write a custom function \u2018plpgsql\u2019 function and use the new OpenLayers 3 to show your route in a web-mapping application.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">InaSAFE for Impact Modelling of Disasters<\/h3>\n<p>Instructor:\u00a0<span style=\"color: #222222;\">Yantisa Akhadi<\/span><\/p>\n<p>InaSAFE is open-source QGIS plugin for performing impact analysis. It\u00a0allows you to use hazard information to determine what would be the impact\u00a0of the specific event on that specific population or infrastructure data.\u00a0For example flood contingency plan that could provide answers\u00a0to the following questions:<br \/>\n&#8211; Which areas are most likely to be affected?<br \/>\n&#8211; How many people will need to be evacuated and sheltered?<br \/>\n&#8211; Which schools will be closed?<br \/>\n&#8211; Which hospitals can still take patients?<br \/>\nInaSAFE 2.0 including the new features which make even easier to get started\u00a0will be introduced and following topics will be covered in the workshop:<br \/>\n&#8211; Installing and configuring InaSAFE<br \/>\n&#8211; Introduction to hazard and exposure data<br \/>\n&#8211; How to source data for analysis<br \/>\n&#8211; Running an impact analysis<br \/>\n&#8211; Interpreting results<br \/>\n&#8211; Introduction to the InaSAFE community and where to get help<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">UNIGIS<\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Instructor: Shahnawaz<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Advances in the infrastructure supporting online distance learning (ODL) have brought an added responsibility to the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) of repute to demonstrate their excellence beyond the classroom based delivery of education. Though a number of HEIs have launched ODL courses but they face a number of challenges in imparting effective education especially in the fields requiring \u2018hands-on\u2019 practical assignments based on commercial software e.g. Geographical Information Science and Systems.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0UNIGIS International Association (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.unigis.net\/\">www.unigis.net<\/a>) is the world\u2019s premier distance education initiative offering masters and diploma programmes in Geographical Information Science and Systems. As a global network of higher education institutions (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.unigis.net\/study-programmes\/map\">www.unigis.net\/study-programmes\/map<\/a>), UNIGIS is dedicated to enhance the competence of GIS professionals worldwide! The main goal of UNIGIS programmes is to equip students with profound and extensive knowledge, insights, skills, and expertise in the field of Geographic Information Science; to train students in scientific research; to establish an attitude of life-long learning; and to orientate students towards further career development. UNIGIS Study Programmes are focussed on life-long learning, supporting part-time study by in-service professionals as well as everybody pursuing a career in Geoinformatics through continuing education.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Workshop Schedule and Venue : 2 December 2014 1.
