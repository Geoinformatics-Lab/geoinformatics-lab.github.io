Monitoring and management of the large-scale construction projects like railway or metro links, which usually spread over a large\u00a0area, are the difficult and challenging tasks. Current practice relies on frequent field survey and reports submitted from sub-contractors of which the validation is uneasy and time-consuming. To speed up the process and enhance the efficiency in management,\u00a0we introduce the employment of remote sensing images and geospatial technologies in building up a location-based management system for construction project monitoring and management. We fully use open-source tools for remote sensing image processing, information processing and web-services development, which is cost-effective and flexible\u00a0for integration with other systems and future extension.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0FOSS-4G for construction project monitoring Presenter:\u00a0Tuong-Thuy Vu Type:\u00a0Oral This paper reports our recent implementation of&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1705"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1705"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1705\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1946,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1705\/revisions\/1946"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1705"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
