This format primary role is to be a common data exchange format that allows researchers to experiment and commercial software to process full waveform LiDAR without\u00a0struggling with a smorgasbord of proprietary formats. It was developed in an open, transparent, and vendor-neutral process since December 2011 through active involvement of the community via the discussion forum at http:\/\/pulsewaves.org. The specification together with the C++ source code that implements an API and a DLL are LGPL-licensed and available for download. The format offers (optional) compression and has been integrated into RIEGL\\&#8217;s commercial RiPROCESS software as a new option for exporting full waveform LiDAR.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We describe a\u00a0full waveform LiDAR scan we have carried out above the primary rainforest of Khao Yai National Park to motivate the utility of this standard and the advantages such data can offer. \u00a0Our scanner recorded the entire interaction between the laser pulse and all vegetation layers down to the ground for a rainforest containing trees up to 45 meters tall. We give\u00a0insights how full waveform LiDAR may\u00a0offers advantages over discrete return LiDAR, which often do not deliver many\u00a0ground points\u00a0in tropical forests. In particular, it should be possible to extract those faint waveform peaks usually not recorded and extract additional details about the topology of the terrain that is often missing from traditional LiDAR surveys.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0Scanning and Exploring a Rainforest in Full Waveform LiDAR Presenter :\u00a0Martin Isenburg Type:\u00a0Oral The three&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1731"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1731"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1731\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1929,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1731\/revisions\/1929"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1731"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
