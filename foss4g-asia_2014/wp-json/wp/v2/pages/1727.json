In much of the cash-strapped societies of the developing world, solutions which are economically viable need focus than building solutions which are all encompassing and comprehensive. The availability of OSM to a great extent can be used for showing a GIS background in India, over which new themes can be easily built. The themes thus built using popular FOSS4G tools like Qgis, gvSIG or OpenJUMP, may be uploaded back on OSM, for data addition through crowd sourcing. A case being built for the coastal city of Vishakhapatnam, Andhrapradesh(A.P) ,India is presented here. Geo-tagging Aadhar-cards (a unique citizen ID) which is much in the news in the state of A.P, is shown as an example, with a belief that this can be emulated as a business model. This can usher in employment for the field workers, who can be trained in data logging with Androiid based smart phones. All the steps that lead to the showcasable product right from downloading data from OSM to Qgis adding new collected data with smart phones and posting on the web using postGIS, Geoserver and OpenLayers are illustrated.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0OSM2GIS a Business Model Presenter :\u00a0K.S.Rajan Type:\u00a0Oral Open Street Maps (OSM) provides the much needed&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1727"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1727"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1727\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1933,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1727\/revisions\/1933"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1727"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
