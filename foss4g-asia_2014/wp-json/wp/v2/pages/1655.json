At present, geographic information science research, geographic information education, geographic information technology receive considerable attention, and get quick development. In contrast, open-source GIS appears divorced from the mainstream technologies, not known by many professions for developers, and the philosophies of \\&#8221;open source\\&#8221; and \\&#8221;open data\\&#8221; are far from being recognized by the mainstream community. Among these, there are a variety of reasons. The paper studies and analysis the historical development, legal consciousness, background of the times, homeland security, etc. The article points out that, due to Chinese cultural heritage, education system and government regulation, the open-source GIS and open geographic data in China is hard to be recognized. In the future, there needs more publicity to make people identity the idea of open geographical sciences; and, more \\&#8221;open source\\&#8221;, \\&#8221;open science\\&#8221; factors in the basis of geographic information education should be added. No matter how, Chinese is good at learning, when Chinese people realize the importance of the \\&#8221;Open\\&#8221; idea for the development of geographical information science, the open source GIS software and open geographic data will get rapid and persistent development in China.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:Current Situation and Future Trends of Open Source GIS software and Open Geographic Data in&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1655"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1655"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1655\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1962,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1655\/revisions\/1962"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1655"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
