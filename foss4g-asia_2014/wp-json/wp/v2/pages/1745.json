In 2013, eight small GIS companies who have actively used Opensource GIS for their business came together and created a forum, called KAOS-G forum. This forum is mainly to promote Opensource GIS in South Korea and many members of KAOS-G forum are also members of OSGeo Korean Chapter. KAOS-G forum is also sharing Opensource GIS technologies and marketing strategies, handling Government\u2019s policies about Opensource GIS, and cooperating and collaborating against global and dominant players. I want to talk about the environment in Korean GIS industry a little bit to explain the birth background of KAOS-G forum and share goals and activities of KAOS-G to the FOSS4G Asia attendees.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:Introduction to KAOS-G Presenter :\u00a0Heegu Park Type:\u00a0Oral I will introduce to KAOS-G which stands for&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1745"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1745"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1745\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1927,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1745\/revisions\/1927"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1745"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
