Additionally we will give a brief outlook and introduction of upcoming new features like the \u00a0\u201cVehicle Routing Problem\u201d (VRP) solver, and what we have in mind for future releases.rnrnWe will explain the shortest path search in real road networks and how the data structure is important to get better routing results. Furthermore we will show how you can improve the quality of the search with dynamic costs and make the result look closer to the reality. You will also learn about difficulties and limitations of the library, and when pgRouting might not be not the right tool to solve your routing problem.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0Shortest Path search in your Database and more with pgRouting Presenter :\u00a0Daniel Kastl Type:\u00a0Oral pgRouting&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1746"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1746"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1746\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1925,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1746\/revisions\/1925"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1746"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
