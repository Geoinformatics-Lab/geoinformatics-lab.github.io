GeoTools is a JAVA library based on open source(LGPL) that provides standardized method for operation and control of geographical information data. It provides functions such as interface determination of the spatial data structure, format of the various file types including vector and raster, support for spatial DBMS, elaborate data transection and access, and projection of various maps.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: small;\">GXT follows the OGC\u00ae Standards and it is GIS engine with high interoperability between the platforms. The provided analysis process is comprised of geometry, vector, raster, statistics, custom algorithm, and supports 230 GIS analyzing algorithm. GXT analysis function as plugin for uDig, eclipse RCP based open source desktop GIS program, can be added and GXT analysis process can be used employing WPS Extension at GeoServer. GXT analysis function is available for free when used for research and education.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:OpenSource Based Software \u2018GXT\u2019 Presenter: \u00a0Siwoon Jung Type:\u00a0Oral GXT is an abbreviation for GeoXTreme, and&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1632"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1632"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1632\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1964,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1632\/revisions\/1964"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1632"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
