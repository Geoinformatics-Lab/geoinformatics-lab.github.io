She got Ph.D in GIS from Pusan National University, Korea. She served ISO\/TC211 as a project leader of ISO19151 while she was researching at Maine University in US as a post-doc. She gives a consulting on National Geospatial Information Policy to governments; Chilean government in 2012, Kazakhstan government in 2014. She organizes an international training program on GI policy to invite officials abroad to Korea and share GI experiences annually. Her research interests focus on GI\/SDI policy, SDI Master-Plan, Policy assessment, Geospatial eco-system, and Open Source Geospatial Software. She has given lectures on \u2018Geospatial Standards\u2019 to government officials at Training Institute for Land Infrastructure and Transport in Korea from 2009.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Title : Open Geospatial Policy, even for Government-funded GIS R&amp;D<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Korean government has invested billions of dollars on GIS R&amp;D from 1995\u00a0when National GIS policy was started. It aimed at developing our own GIS\u00a0technologies and providing them to Korean geospatial society. On the other\u00a0hands, hundreds of GIS application systems such as Korea Land Information\u00a0System, Building Management System, Forest Management System and so on had\u00a0been built to enhance government businesses. However the outcomes of GIS\u00a0R&amp;S had rarely used to the development of government\u2019 GIS applications. Why\u00a0the result of GIS R&amp;D policy was different from the intention of GIS R&amp;D on\u00a0the planning phase?<\/p>\n<p>Korean government gives an effort to reveal its causes and to defines\u00a0challenges from the various point of views. And open policy is regarded as\u00a0a great alternative among approaches which Korean government is considering\u00a0to overcome the challenges. This is a brief background why Korean\u00a0government launches a new Open GIS R&amp;D which I will introduce at FOSS4G\u00a0ASIA conference.<\/p>\n<p>The presentation will deliver more details on: the history of Korean GIS\u00a0R&amp;D, the status of GIS application systems on the public sector in Korea,\u00a0the goal of new Open GIS R&amp;D and its components such as a development\u00a0scope, and members who are involved in the project. The case of Korean\u00a0government which is considering to hire an open geospatial approach will\u00a0give an inspiration to other governments who are still doubt to bring an\u00a0open geospatial policy to their national SDI policy.<\/p>\n<p><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Kang_HaeKyong.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1352 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Kang_HaeKyong-202x300.png\" alt=\"Kang_HaeKyong\" width=\"202\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Kang_HaeKyong-202x300.png 202w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Kang_HaeKyong-125x185.png 125w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Kang_HaeKyong-99x148.png 99w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Kang_HaeKyong-20x31.png 20w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Kang_HaeKyong-25x38.png 25w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Kang_HaeKyong-144x215.png 144w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Kang_HaeKyong.png 343w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"one-third last\"><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><\/div><div class=\"clear\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1148,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1351"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1351"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1351\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2228,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1351\/revisions\/2228"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1148"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1351"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
