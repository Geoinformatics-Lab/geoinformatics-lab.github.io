Also, the current indoor technologies like WiFi does not practically respond the answer in terms of the low accuracy, and burdened process of creating the radio map. Therefore, this study will solve those problems, which comprises of main three objectives; to investigate the optimum number of scanned points, to develop a hybrid system between WiFi and NFC technology, which has the additional turn-by-turn function viewed on Augmented Reality called IndoorNavi application, and to evaluate a standalone WiFi system with the IndoorNavi. Consequently, we found that the number of scanned point can be reduced to 80 points from 160 points but still keep the acceptable accuracy depending on the area of study, the IndoorNavi has been developed based on Android platform, and open source software such as pgRouting, OSMDroid, and Tilemill, which includes of multiple functions such as specifying and routing the location, turn-by-turn Augmented Reality view, and tracking the users. For the result of the evaluation, we found that the hybrid system has ability to increase the accuracy to 83 % in ideal condition as well as the number of getting out of the route and the time of user arrival have become less than using only WiFi system.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Keywords<\/em><\/strong><strong>:<\/strong>Hybrid indoor navigation, indoor positioning, NFC, location based services<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:IndoorNavi: A Hybrid Indoor Mobile Navigation System based on WiFi and NFC Positioning Techniques Presenter&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1728"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1728"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1728\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1932,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1728\/revisions\/1932"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1728"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
