There are multiple-entry visas available in this visa class; you\u2019re more likely to be granted multiple entries if you apply at a Thai consulate in Europe, the US or Australia than elsewhere. If you plan to apply for a Thai work permit, you\u2019ll need to possess a Non-Immigrant Visa \ufb01rst.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Visas The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (www.mfa.go.th) oversees immigration and visas issues.
