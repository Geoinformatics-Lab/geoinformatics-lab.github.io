They are using \u201con-site\u201d systems such as septic tanks or pit latrines. Latrine pits and septic tanks need to be emptied periodically, as the densely built urban environment won\u2019t allow new pits to be dug every time they fill up. In the conventional faecal management systems authorities are collecting the sludge from house to house and dump on the plant. Collection vehicles move from the depot to the customers and carry sludge to the treatment plant. Due to customer\u2019s diverse location and limited capacity of carrying vehicles, authorities are facing proper networking problems. This problem is different from traditional vehicle routing and Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). This paper is going to identify optimized route in terms of cost and time considering capacity of vehicles to cover maximum customers. It will develop an algorithm of demand generation indicating the potential customer zone. Plug-ins for QGIS will be developed using open source software for visualization and algorithm implementation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:GIS Oriented Networking and Service Optimization Techniques for Faecal Sludge Management Presenter: Dr. Sarawut Ninsawat&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1669"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1669"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1669\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1960,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1669\/revisions\/1960"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1669"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
