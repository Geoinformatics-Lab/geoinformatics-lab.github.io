This area is under high risk of flood hazard every year. An algorithm, namely BS-Horizon using Fortran program (Nonogaki et al., 2012) was used to create DEM for this flat area. BS_Horizon was evaluated as one of the highest accuracy method for generating DEM with the bi-cubic B-spline algorithm. This algorithm enables using elevation data as equality-inequality constraints on the surface. The optimal surface is the smoothest one that satisfied the given constraints (Nonogaki et al., 2012). The contour lines and elevation points data extracted from 1:10000 topographic map were used as input data in BS-Horizon. DEM from BS-Horizon has the higher accuracy than DEMs from other methods and supports to extract reliable geomorphologic features . From this DEM, a potential flood hazard map was built based on landform classification result and land-cover map. The result was compared with past flood inundation map and flood prones map given by Danang city government to validate the flood hazard prediction map.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic: DEM Generation and Flood Hazard Assessment by a Geomorphological approach Presenter\u00a0:\u00a0Venkatesh Raghavan Type:\u00a0Oral In&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1677"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1677"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1677\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1956,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1677\/revisions\/1956"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1677"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
