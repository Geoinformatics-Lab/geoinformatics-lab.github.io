He has been working as a researcher at National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), Ministry of Science and Technology, Thailand since 1992. In NECTEC he was the director of Next Generation Internet Laboratory, the director of Intelligent Transport System program and the director of Information Communications and Computing Research Unit. At present, he serves as the director of SRI (Service Research &amp; Innovation program), NSTDA and the editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Intelligent Transportation System Research, Springer. He is also the president of the Thai Intelligent Transport System (ITS) association or ITS Thailand. Besides, he is the co-founder of Thailand IPv6 association, Thai Intelligent Traffic Information Center Foundation and the CCTV Analytic Consortium.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Title: The opportunity for developing Intelligent Transport Systems with FOSS4G.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Intelligent Tranpsort Systems (ITS) are advanced application and service in transportation where the ICT is the key solution that creates innovaive ITS for safety, convenience and environment friendly.<\/span>The FOSS4G, Open Data and Open Standard would play a major role in the ITS development.This talk will raise the requirement in ITS applications. We have seen ITS application based on geoinfomatics like\u00a0waze, Uber and Google transit. There will be more rooms of opportunity for better service and more idea of innovative ITS if FOSS4G get involve.\u00a0Let&#8217;s share the experience and idea.<\/p>\n<p><\/div>\n<div class=\"one-third last\"><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Passakon-Prathombutr.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1522\" src=\"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Passakon-Prathombutr.png\" alt=\"Passakon-Prathombutr\" width=\"200\" height=\"264\" srcset=\"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Passakon-Prathombutr.png 200w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Passakon-Prathombutr-125x165.png 125w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Passakon-Prathombutr-112x148.png 112w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Passakon-Prathombutr-23x31.png 23w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Passakon-Prathombutr-28x38.png 28w, https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Passakon-Prathombutr-162x215.png 162w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><\/div><div class=\"clear\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1148,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1520"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1520"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1520\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2305,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1520\/revisions\/2305"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1148"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1520"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
