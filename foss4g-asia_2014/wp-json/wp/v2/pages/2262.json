FIMS aims at providing solutions in the area of real estate, infrastructure, and facility management solution. FIMS provides GIS based visualization, planning, analysis, and reporting tools that help in delivering excellent operational insight and cost management.<\/p>\n<p>The objective of FIMS is to ensure that the users are able to efficiently manage; space, people, and assets, and in turn enhance customer satisfaction which would lead to an increase in overall organizational productivity.<br \/>\nThis paper presents a framework for the development of FIMS using open source tools and technologies. The proposed FIMS is designed as a thin client application, which is using HTML and Java Script with a combination of various client side APIs like JQuery, JQuery Mobile, JSON, KML and Google Map API to make application robust and highly responsive. Application has zero post back model during its entire life cycle. Business logic has been written using C# and can be invoked by client through web services which are provided by FIMS framework. Web Services are called using Ajax calls which make application very responsive as they consume very less bandwidth for data communication between client and server over the network.<br \/>\nFIMS consists of following main modules whereas each module has multiple sub modules.<br \/>\nArea Management<br \/>\nNetwork Management<br \/>\nInventory and Equipment Management<br \/>\nCarbon footprint Management<br \/>\nEnergy consumption Management<br \/>\nCarbon footprint Management<\/p>\n<p>Keywords: Facility management, JSON, Google Map Api, KML, Web Services.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0Facility and Asset Information Management System using FOSS Presenter :\u00a0Muhammad Amir Izhar Type: Poster The&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1891,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2262"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2262"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2262\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2264,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2262\/revisions\/2264"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1891"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2262"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
