However, the serious urban problems (land subsidence, groundwater pollution, flood and so on) are increasing year after year. To consider the city as a three dimensional (3D) spatial area (from underground to surface), and generate the basis data for diverse study fields is important. In this study, generate some 3D basis model using effective tools. Firstly, we need to generate the DEM (Digital Elevation Model) using the elevation survey data. DEM is a digital representation of ground surface topography and the most important element of topographic analysis for urban transfiguration. Finally, we are analyzing the borehole data for well construction of Hanoi to input the 3D geologic modeling system based on Web-GIS. We collected 120 points borehole data of Hanoi City. This system has been developed to perform acquisition of the field survey data, construction of the model, and visualization of the results on Web for sharing and providing 3D geologic information. This research indicates the fundamental urban 3D model and its application for the transformation of Hanoi city.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a03D Geological Modeling for Hanoi City Using Borehole Data Author:Go Yonezawa Type:\u00a0Oral Hanoi city, the&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1692"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1692"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1692\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1951,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1692\/revisions\/1951"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1692"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
