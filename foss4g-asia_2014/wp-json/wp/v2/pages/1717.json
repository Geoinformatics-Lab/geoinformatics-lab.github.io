While introductory\u00a0subjects\u00a0for the degree program are mainly being\u00a0taught using proprietary software, a gradual shift to FOSS4G applications has been observed in\u00a0others.\u00a0One of these\u00a0is\u00a0the core subject,\u00a0GmE 205: Object Oriented Programming for Geospatial Applications,\u00a0whose\u00a0main objective is to teach geospatial programming to MS level students who may or may not have programming background.<\/p>\n<p>The course is subdivided into four main parts, namely 1) Introduction to Object Oriented Programming, 2) Raster Processing, 3) Vector Processing, and 4) Miscellaneous Topics.\u00a0For the last two years,\u00a0the\u00a0Python\u00a0programming language, OGR and GDAL libraries have\u00a0been used for instruction in GmE 205.\u00a0These are used to tackle the\u00a0first\u00a0three topics in order, while miscellaneous topics includes short lectures on QGIS python plugin development, Openlayers, etc.\u00a0OGR\/GDAL allows the subject to focus more on the geospatial processing over geospatial classes and objects theory. In lieu of\u00a0this,\u00a0the students have become better equipped to handle contemporary geospatial problems. This has resulted in more useful class projects, that are directly utilized for research and even operational purposes.\u00a0In all, the utilization of FOSS4G for instruction has resulted in increased appreciation\u00a0for subjects not just on the theoretical sense but more on the practical applications.<\/p>\n<p><b>Keyword<\/b><b>s<\/b><b>:<\/b>\u00a0Python, OGR, GDAL, Geospatial Programming<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0Python, OGR, and GDAL for Geospatial Programming Instruction in MS Geomatics Engineering in the University&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1717"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1717"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1717\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1943,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1717\/revisions\/1943"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1717"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
