This has lead to a strong upsurge of Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) and consequently to dramatic land-use changes. To get more control of these developments and to tackle potential land conflicts, the Lao Government (with support from international donors) has set up a nationwide inventory on land concessions. The inventory was conducted using QGIS as a user-backend and a PostGIS database to manage the complex informations related to the land concessions. The programming and implementation of the concession database has shown that it is possible to setup a sophisticated database management system with zero license costs and, using QGIS as a backend, no need to develop additional user interfaces for data entry. Once setup, the concession database application can be used by governmental staff after a couple of days training and being used as a powerful tool to spatially visualize and analyse the current situation of land concessions countrywide.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0Large-scale investments into land: FOSS-GIS technology in the land management sector of Laos Presenter:Stefan Sylla&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1714"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1714"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1714\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1944,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1714\/revisions\/1944"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1714"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
