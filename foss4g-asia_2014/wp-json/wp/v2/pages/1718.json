Wherever is possible the more appropriate and\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">desired<\/span><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">\u00a0risk management approach is a wise land use planning regulation in order to reduce as much as possible people and valuable objects exposition. Unfortunately, in most of the cases, people and developed areas are located in areas\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">already<\/span><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">\u00a0threaten by different types of risks like, for example,\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">flooding<\/span><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">\u00a0of nearby rivers, inundations from\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">surrounding<\/span><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">\u00a0lakes or landslides from the nearby mountain slopes. In all these cases, where the\u00a0<\/span><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">relocation<\/span><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">\u00a0of people and economic activities is not applicable, an early warning system may support the risk reduction by means of timely intervention actions and emergency plan actuation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p lang=\"\\&quot;en-GB\\&quot;\" align=\"\\&quot;justify\\&quot;\"><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">Thanks to impressive technological advances the visionary concept of the Digital Earth (Gore 1992, 1998) is being realizing: geospatial coverages and monitoring systems data are increasingly available on the Web, and more importantly, in a standard format. As a result, today is possible to develop innovative decision support systems (Molinari et al. 2013) which mesh-up several information sources and offers special features for risk scenarios evaluation. In agreement with the exposed view, the authors have recently developed a new Web system whose design is based on the Service Oriented Architecture pattern. Open source software (e.g.: Geoserver, PostGIS, OpenLayers) has been used throughout the whole system and geospatial Open Standards (e.g.: SOS, WMS, WFS) are the pillars it rely on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p lang=\"\\&quot;en-GB\\&quot;\" align=\"\\&quot;justify\\&quot;\"><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">SITGAP 2.0, implemented in collaboration with the Civil protection of Locarno e Vallemaggia, combines a number of data sources such as the Federal Register of Buildings and Dwellings, the Cantonal Register of residents, the Cadastral Surveying, the Cantonal Hydro-meteorological monitoring observations, the Meteoswiss weather forecasts, and others. As a result of this orchestration of data, SITGAP 2.0 serves features that allows, for example, to be informed on active alarms, to visualize lake level forecasts and associated flooding areas, to evaluate and map exposed elements and people, to plan and manage evacuation by searching for people living in particular areas or buildings, by registering evacuation actions and by searching for evacuated people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>System architecture and functionalities, and consideration on the integration and accessibility of the beneath information provides interesting discussion points for the identification of current and future needs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p lang=\"\\&quot;en-GB\\&quot;\"><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">REFERENCES<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Gore, A. 1992: Earth in the Balance.
