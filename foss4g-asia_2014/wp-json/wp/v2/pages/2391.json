Though a number of HEIs have launched ODL courses but they face a number of challenges in imparting effective education especially in the fields requiring \u2018hands-on\u2019 practical assignments based on commercial software e.g. Geographical Information Science and Systems.<\/p>\n<p>UNIGIS International Association (www.unigis.net) is the world\u2019s premier distance education initiative offering masters and diploma programmes in Geographical Information Science and Systems. As a global network of higher education institutions (www.unigis.net\/study-programmes\/map), UNIGIS is dedicated to enhance the competence of GIS professionals worldwide! The main goal of UNIGIS programmes is to equip students with profound and extensive knowledge, insights, skills, and expertise in the field of Geographic Information Science; to train students in scientific research; to establish an attitude of life-long learning; and to orientate students towards further career development. UNIGIS Study Programmes are focussed on life-long learning, supporting part-time study by in-service professionals as well as everybody pursuing a career in Geoinformatics through continuing education.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic: UNIGIS &#8211; Online Distance Learning in Geographical Information Science and Systems Presenter : Dr&#8230;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2391"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2391"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2391\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2393,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2391\/revisions\/2393"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2391"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
