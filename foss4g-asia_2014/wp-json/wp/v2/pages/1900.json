A Web-based application is has developed to facilitate ubiquitous dynamic routing services on up-to-date road network data. An improved weighted travel-time algorithm has been developed by integrating pgRouting and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Routes computations are done considering situation at source, transit and destinations and the AHP is used to prioritize amongst possible destination considering impedance factors affecting travel time. The routing algorithm is deployed as Web Processing Service (WPS) is using the ZOO kernel. Another highlight of the work is a jQuery-based mobile application which is employed to update the ERDP database from field sites.rnTwo scenarios for application of the ERDP Web services are demonstrated. In the first scenario of medical emergency, the ERDP computes routes to hospital in proximity of accident site considering dynamic factors such as conditions of road network, the patient\u2019s state and availability of medical facilities and expertise in the target hospital. In the second scenario of disaster situation, the GRASS GIS r.sim.water simulation model for overland flow under rainfall excess conditions was integrated into the ERDP system as a WPS. The result of the simulation is used to automatically update the road network database and new routes are computed based on existing conditions. The system is developed FOSS4G and its SOA makes to easily amenable to customization to support other emergencies such as fire, debris flow and tsunami. Integration with Sensor Observation Services for automatic data updates from CCTV camera and weather stations could further improve utility as a real-time ERDP system.rn<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0Development of Dynamic Routing Service for Emergency Scenarios using FOSS4G Presenter : Sittichai choosumrong Type:&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1900"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1900"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1900\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2443,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1900\/revisions\/2443"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1900"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
