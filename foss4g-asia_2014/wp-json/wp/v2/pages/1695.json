These characteristics always challenge AP planners that &#8220;How to decide an effective plan for any AP project?&#8221;. in other words, is to complete the job and minimize time. This study, as a part of working project of Royal Thai Survey Department (RTSD) Aerial Photography decision and planning development, aims to develop an AP decision support tool to deal with such challenge. To do so, an AP planning algorithm is formulated and constructed as a plug-in by Python code through a portal of QGIS under the concept to deal with AP planing characteristics. The basic idea is to support AP planner to decide settlements of an AP base for AP operation. The decision of AP base settlement directly determines time consumption\u00a0which is the most important factor influencing the cost of any AP project.\u00a0At the current stage, the plug-in is capable to support considering of single AP base settlement. This consideration helps AP planners to choose a suitable AP base in any project areas. The progress of study draws another possible framework to deal with AP planning through QGIS as a FOSS4G which benefits both users and developers in term of flexibility, customizability and economy. Meanwhile the results can be utilized as baselines and considerations for real AP planning. However, there are still other challenges to integrate additional factors such as weather conditions and decision algorithm to improve the plug-in to work more realistically those would be recommended for further studies.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Topic:\u00a0Aerial Photography Decision and Planning, an approach of FOSS4G Author:Warakan supinajaroen Type:\u00a0Oral Aerial Photography (AP)&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":1621,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1695"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1695"}],"version-history":[{"count":6,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1695\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2149,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1695\/revisions\/2149"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1621"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1695"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
