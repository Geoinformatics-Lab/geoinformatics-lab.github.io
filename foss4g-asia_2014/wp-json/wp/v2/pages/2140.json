Organize your ideas in a way that these objectives can be achieved. Posters should be simple and yet elaborate; they should be prepared having in mind, primarily, their use as a basis for the presentation and discussion of the work that is already published in the Conference Proceedings. However, they should be also self-intelligible. Make your poster presentation easy to read with good visual display. Remember the audience will have only a short time frame to pay attention to your presentation. Use color for highlighting and to make your poster more attractive. Use pictures, diagrams, cartoons, figures, etc., rather than only text wherever possible. Make your poster as self-explanatory as possible. This will save your time to use for discussions and questions.<\/p>\n<p><b>Guidelines summary<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The following summarizes some of the most relevant points for the poster section:<br \/>\n<\/span><span class=\"s5\"><b>Poster size<\/b><\/span><span class=\"s1\">: 46.8&#215;33.1 inch (841&#215;1189 millimetres) A0 size<\/p>\n<p>Style to be used in the poster:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>TITLE (SAME AS PUBLISHED), CAPITAL LETTERS,<br \/>\nARIAL 46 TO 48, BOLD, CENTER ALIGNED;<br \/>\nSCIENTIFIC NAMES FOLLOWING INTERNATIONAL RULES<br \/>\n(e.g.: Tibraca limbativentris STAL)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Author(s) names, Arial 32, center aligned; underline presenting author<\/p>\n<p>Affiliation(s), address(es); presentingauther@mail.mail<\/p>\n<p><b>SUMMARY (ARIAL 38, CAPITAL LETTERS, BOLD,<br \/>\nCENTER ALIGNED)<\/b><br \/>\nText of summary, Arial 36, justified or not.<\/p>\n<p><b>INTRODUCTION (ARIAL 38, CAPITAL LETTERS,<br \/>\nBOLD, CENTER ALIGNED)<\/b><br \/>\nText of topic, Arial 36, justified or not.<\/p>\n<p><b>MATERIAL AND METHODS (ARIAL 38, CAPITAL<br \/>\nLETTERS, BOLD, CENTER ALIGNED)<\/b><br \/>\nText of topic, Arial 36, justified or not.<\/p>\n<p><b>RESULTS (ARIAL 38, CAPITAL LETTERS,<br \/>\nBOLD, CENTER ALIGNED)<\/b><br \/>\nText of topic, Arial 36, justified or not.<\/p>\n<p><b>CONCLUSIONS (ARIAL 38, CAPITAL<br \/>\nLETTERS, BOLD, CENTER ALIGNED)<\/b><br \/>\nText of topic, Arial 36, justified or not.<\/p>\n<p><b>Acknowledgements<\/b> can also be included at<br \/>\nThe end of the text<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Poster Presentation Instructions for Foss4G-ASIA 2014 Introduction: An ideal poster should cover the main points&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":759,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"template-full-width.php","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2140"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2140"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2140\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2488,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2140\/revisions\/2488"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/759"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2014\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2140"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
