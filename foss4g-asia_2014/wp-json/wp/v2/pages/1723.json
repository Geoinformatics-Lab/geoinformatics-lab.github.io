These estimations are transformed in optimal irrigation rules (using also FAO56 model) that are communicated to ENORASIS system end users (farmers) via web or mobile.<\/p>\n<p>Information about each land zone is managed by the Land Management Subsystem. In the fields, sensors and water valves are deployed. The sensors collect raw data about various parameters affecting irrigation management (soil moisture, air temperature and humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, rain gage) and send their measurements to the ENORASIS server, where are managed through a istSOS 2.1 service. The water valves which also send their status to the SOS service are controlled by the ENORASIS application server. Sites specific meteorological models, which run over satellite images, daily provide the next 72 hours forecasts.<\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">SOS (http:\/\/istgeo.ist.supsi.ch\/software\/istsos) is an OGC SOS server implementation the SOS service entirely written in Python for exchanging XML requests and responses. istSOS 2.1 allows for managing and dispatching observations from monitoring sensors according to the Sensor Observation Service standard.<\/span>rnrn<span lang=\"\\&quot;en-US\\&quot;\">The talk will present the latest software enhancements (version 2.1) that include the availability of a RESTful Web API written in Python for automating administration procedures and wrapping SOS functionalities and a Web graphical user Interface written in HTML\/Javascript\/CSS that allows for easing daily operations like service administration or data manipulation.
