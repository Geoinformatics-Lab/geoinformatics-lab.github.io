It was constructed with funds raised from American officers and Salvation Army members in 1926, and the two-story brick building was completed in November 1928.<br><br>&nbsp;Initially named the Salvation Army Officer Training School, the architecture is characterized by a simple yet symmetrical design, featuring a triangular pediment at the center of the front facade, and a unique roof structure known as the &#8216;Hammer Beam.&#8217; The exterior exhibits a faithful reflection of the neogothic style with brickwork and four columns at the central entrance.<br>&nbsp;From 1955 to 1981, it was jointly used as the Salvation Army&#8217;s headquarters in Korea, and in 1959, after some expansion and renovation, it became known as the &#8216;Salvation Army Central Hall.&#8217; While there have been some additions and modifications, the building has retained much of its original design, making it a significant architectural landmark from the late 1920s in Seoul. It also holds historical significance as it witnessed the Salvation Army&#8217;s experiences during the Japanese colonial period, anti-Shinto shrine protests, the scars of the Korean War (1950-1953), and Korea&#8217;s modernization process.<br><br>&nbsp;Recognizing its historical and architectural value, it was designated as Seoul Metropolitan City Monument No. 20 in 2002. Since 2019, it has been operated as the &#8216;Jeongdong 1928 Art Center,&#8217; serving as an open and diverse cultural and arts space.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Address and Contact<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Address: 130 Deoksugung-gil, Jung-gu, Seoul<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Contact: 02-722-1928<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">For more information, visit the official website: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jeongdong1928.com\/\">https:\/\/www.jeongdong1928.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(CC) \ub0b4 \uc190\uc548\uc5d0 \uc11c\uc6b8 Upcoming Events **Ice Break Event:** &#8211; Date: 11\/29, 18:30~20:00 &#8211; Venue: Event Hall, Jeongdong 1928 Art Center Enjoy a new networking opportunity at the FOSS4G-Asia 2023 Seoul Ice Break event with finger foods prepared for you \ud83d\ude42 **Gala Event:** &#8211; Date: 11\/30, 18:30~20:00 &#8211; Venue: Event Hall, Jeongdong 1928 Art Center &hellip; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":1197,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2023\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/131"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2023\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2023\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2023\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2023\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=131"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2023\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/131\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1596,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2023\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/131\/revisions\/1596"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2023\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1197"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2023\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=131"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
