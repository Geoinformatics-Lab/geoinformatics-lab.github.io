Workshops will be run by experienced members of the open source community, and sometimes by the actual developers. As such, they are a fantastic opportunity to learn new skills or take your first steps into the world of Open Source GIS. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For workshops, we are offering <strong>&#8216;Bring Your Own Laptop&#8217;<\/strong> style format. We will provide workshop rooms without computers for participants to use. This allows for more participants, but past experience has shown that this may require significant set-up time. Therefore instructors will need to discuss pre-installation requirements with workshop participants. The contact details of the participants will be provided by FOSS4G-Asia Seoul team later.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Instructors are strongly encouraged to use bootable media such as the OSGeo Live USB stick, or cloud server to reduce set-up time and to increase efficiency.<\/strong><\/em>&nbsp;Workshops require considerable effort to produce a high-quality workshop.
