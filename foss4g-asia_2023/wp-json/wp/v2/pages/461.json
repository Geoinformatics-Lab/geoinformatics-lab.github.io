Hastings Award for exceptional contributions to the Free and Open Source Solutions for Geoinformatics (FOSS4G) communities in Asia. Nominees must have contributed to the spread FOSS4G in academia, government and business, promoted the use of FOSS4G in projects in Asia, or helped localize and customize front-end FOSS4G tools for Asian communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">The award is in the fond memory of David, who was an early pioneer of FOSS4G, having written a GRASS GIS How-to [1], as well as being actively involved in the first FOSS4G event at Chulalongkron University in Bangkok Thailand in 2004, where he helped bring the future founders of the annual FOSS4G event Jeff McKenna, Markus Neteler, and Venkatesh Raghavan, together; indeed, they shared many laughs and stories on that special trip together.&nbsp; He also led an \u201c<em>Installfest<\/em>\u201d at that FOSS4G 2004 event, which set the tone for training workshops and software packaging initiatives for subsequent FOSS4G events.<br><br>David would later go on to develop the global level measurement of human development and happiness, what he coined as the Human Security Index [2].<br><br>Dr. David A. Hastings left on his heavenly abode on the 13<sup>th<\/sup> of November, 2017.&nbsp; He leaves behind wonderful memories and deep sense of appreciation with all his friends and colleagues. His wisdom and wit and his contributions long remembered.<br><br>The award will be presented in the closing plenary of the FOSS4G-Asia 2023 event at the Seoul  on 2<sup>nd<\/sup> December 2023.&nbsp; The hope is that this award helps in spreading David\u2019s passion for serving the Free and Open Source communities in Asia now and into the future.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">The organizing committee of the FOSS4G Asia 2021 requests nominations for the David A.

His contributions in the spread of FOSS4G in academic, business and government are truly enormous. He has contributed immensely to localization of FOSS4G tools (especially QGIS) and customization of tools to cater to user needs in Asia and beyond. He is a rare mix of a FOSS4G evangelist and a software developer. His contributions to the Open Source and Open Data Geospatial Community are in the true spirit of David A.
