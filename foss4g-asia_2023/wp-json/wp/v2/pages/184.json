Please read the TGP guidelines below and if you meet the eligibility criteria, feel free to submit your application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who is eligible?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The travel grants are available to individuals from Asian countries, with a focus on assisting those who would not be able to attend otherwise. If you have the means to attend on your own, we kindly request that you refrain from applying. In an effort to foster a diverse community, priority will be given to students, women, and minority attendees from low-income and lower-middle-income countries as classified by the World Bank (see: <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.worldbank.org\/opendata\/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2022-2023\">https:\/\/blogs.worldbank.org\/opendata\/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2022-2023<\/a>). These groups have historically been underrepresented in the open-source community, and we strive to address this disparity. Applicants who have been selected as conference speakers will be given preference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do I apply?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The application process will be open from June 1st until August 19th on the FOSS4G-ASIA Seoul 2023 website. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deadline<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We only accept the TGP application received by <strong>18th August(23:59UTC)<\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Application Form<\/strong><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color\">(Application Closed!<\/mark>)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The&nbsp;TGP&nbsp;evaluation&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;completed,&nbsp;and&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;delighted&nbsp;to&nbsp;announce&nbsp;the&nbsp;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;TGP&nbsp;recipients: ***The TGP recipients are a total of 21 individuals, The waiting list has been closed.*** We look forward to meeting you at the FOSS4G Asia 2023 Seoul.
