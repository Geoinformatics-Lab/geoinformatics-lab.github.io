<h1>
International Symposium on GeoInformatics for Spatial Infrastructure Development
in Earth and Allied Sciences</h1></center>

<center>
<h2>
Hanoi, Vietnam, 25-28 September 2002</h2></center>

<h4>
The International Symposium on Geoinformatics for Spatial Infrastructure
Development in Earth and Allied Sciences, GIS-IDEAS, will take place in
Hanoi, Vietnam, 25-28 September 2002.<br>
<br>
GIS-IDEAS is organised under the aegis of the Japan-Vietnam
Geoinformatics Consortium and will focus on integration of Information
Technology tools for the development of spatial databases and the utilization
of spatial data for mathematical modelling and computer simulation of processes
related to our natural and social environment. Our main interest - besides
general topics in Geoinformatics - will be the process of creating, managing,
distributing, sharing and analysing digital spatial data.</h4>

<h4>
The recent advances in communication technologies have paved new ways for
scientific cooperation by providing the access to data, software and the
scientific publications. Distributed computing as well as Open Source tools
affords for the easy visualization and analysis of spatial data. We believe
that it is necessary to closely examine the application of Geoinformatics
for a sustainable development of our natural environment and to initiate
a broad discussion on specific needs of the developing countries. GIS-IDEAS
not only aims to serve as a forum for scientific exchanges but also as
a conduit for technology transfer through short courses that will be organized
within the framework of the symposium. Further, in order to promote a better
understanding of specific needs, field excursions and visits are also being
planned.</h4>

Pre-registration and Abstract submission has been closed as of March, 15th,
2002. For final Conference Registration please see the <a href="registration.html">Registration
