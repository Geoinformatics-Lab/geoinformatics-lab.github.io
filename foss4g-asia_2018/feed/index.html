<h3><strong>Poster Presenter’s Guide</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A poster session is a <strong>graphic presentation</strong> of an author’s research. Authors illustrate their study findings by displaying graphs, photos, diagrams, and a small amount of text on poster boards. In presenting your research with a poster, you should aim to use the poster as a means for generating <strong>active discussion</strong> of the research. Poster sessions are a valuable opportunity for authors to present papers and meet with <strong>interested attendees for in-depth technical discussions</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Poster sessions are scheduled for </span><strong>90 minutes</strong><span style="font-family: Roboto;">. Location is 5th Floor, Department of Town &amp; Country Planning (as same as area allocate for lunch and tea)</span></span></p>
<p><b>If you wish you can use FOSS4G Asia template attached herewith. Feel free to use and modify it. </b></p>
<h4><strong>Preparing your poster</strong></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The poster must be <strong>A0 size</strong> (A0 size is 841mm x 1189mm) in <strong>portrait orientation</strong>. The <strong>title</strong> should be the same as in the submitted abstract. Display <strong>poster ID</strong> long with the authors Name (Note: Poster ID will be available on the conference website on 25th November, 2018).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The poster should be <strong>easily readable</strong> at a distance of two metres. Use UPPER and lower case for general content as the use of all-capital text is difficult to read. Avoid using a mixture of type/font styles.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Simplicity</strong> is the key. Keep to the point, and don’t try to cover too many things. Present only enough data to support your conclusions. On the other hand, make sure that you present sufficient data to support your conclusions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Presenting authors <strong>should print their physical poster</strong> based on the requirements listed in the sections above. FOSS4G Asia 2018 Conference does not print posters on behalf of presenters.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Authors <strong>may bring additional written material</strong> of a non commercial nature that supplements the material presented on the poster. Business cards is a great networking opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">QR Codes (optional). FOSS4G Asia 2018 is promoting the idea of QR Codes for authors to incorporate into their posters. This would allow you to add a barcode readable by smartphones. The barcode can be designed to link the person viewing your poster to a related video, your website, or your contact information.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Computers without audio may be used to run demonstrations and display additional information or illustrations. No electrical outlets will be provided @ poster session area. Please come with <strong>your computer charged</strong>!, if you want to use in the poster session</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Poster Setup Information</strong></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Poster authors can set-up their posters <strong><u>before 30min</u></strong> on the day of their poster session.</li>
<li><strong>Poster numbers</strong> will be posted on the poster boards in numerical order; please find your paper number and post your poster in the designated space.</li>
<li>FOSS4G Asia 2018 provides a <strong>display board</strong> and <strong>thumbtacks</strong> for presenters to use to attach posters made of paper or lightweight poster board. Bring tape, heavy duty fasteners or tacks as back up to the thumbtacks as determined necessary.</li>
<li>A poster author or coauthor is required to <strong>stand by the poster</strong> during the scheduled poster session to answer questions from attendees.</li>
<li>Presenters <strong>must remove their posters immediately after the poster session.</strong></li>
<li>Posters and other materials not removed at the end of the poster session will be considered unwanted and will be discarded.</li>
<li>FOSS4G Asia 2018 assumes no responsibility for posters left up after the end of each poster session.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1. </strong><strong>No plastic bottled water<br class="kix-line-break" /></strong>There will be <strong>no water in fancy plastic bottles</strong> at the conference. We will give a <strong>glass bottle [only one]</strong> for participants at the registration desk. Please <strong>re-fill and reuse</strong> the bottle through out the conference and <strong>hand it back to us</strong> at the end of the conference.</p>
<p><strong>2. No food left behind</strong><br class="kix-line-break" />Your role in <strong>preventing food waste</strong>, at the conference, is to eat up. Please<strong> plate according to your appetite</strong>. Any leftovers, when the time is over, will be given to the university students.</p>
<p><strong>3. Hand over those name tags</strong><br class="kix-line-break" />If you bring your name tag home as a souvenir, that’s fine with us. But if you have <strong>no use for it, please hand name tag back to us</strong> at the end of the day. Then we will <strong>re-use</strong> <strong>name tag </strong> for another event.</p>
<p><strong>4. Less printing</strong><br class="kix-line-break" />There will be <strong>no printed programmes </strong>and<strong> conference proceedings</strong> (will give USB). All essential information will be sent to you <strong>digitally</strong>, display in conference <strong>common notice board</strong> and available at <strong>conference web site</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Save energy</strong></p>
<p>Please <strong>take the stairs instead of the elevator</strong> to save the university electricity during the conference. The elevator uses a huge amount of energy to move just the .one person. If you are considering taking the elevator alone, you should take the stairs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FOSS4G was first coined in early 2004 as an acronym for Free and Open Source Software for Geoinformatics by a research group working on I18N of GRASS and MapServer. The first publication defining and using the FOSS4G acronym was published in Japan in March 2004 in a paper entitled &#8220;Development of training material and internationalization of GRASS GIS and MapServer for advancing FOSS4G solutions&#8221; published in the Bulletin of Osaka City University Media Center(ISSN: 1345-4145). It was later used at the Free/Libre and Open Source Software for Geoinformatics: GIS-GRASS Users Conference held between September 12 &#8211; 14, 2004 in Bangkok, Thailand in a publication entitled Implementation of Web Map Server Test-bed and Development of Training Material for Advancing FOSS4G Solutions and subsequently in several other international and national conferences and meetings.</p>
