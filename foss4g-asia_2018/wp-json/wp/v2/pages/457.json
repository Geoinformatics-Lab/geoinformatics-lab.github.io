This Code Sprint is a unique opportunity to experience open source collaborative development and to meet FOSS4G users and developers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We are following the old tradition of hosting a codesprint on the FOSS4G Asia. More precisely, we offer a setting so that individual projects can meet for their codesprint. Since projects benefit from each other as well, the codesprint will naturally be held conjointly at one place.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>During the FOSS4G Asia there will be space and time for you to improve your favorite Open Source project. Since projects benefit from working with each other as well, there will be also a dedicated day for the codesprint,\u00a0 5 December 2018, the last day of the conference.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is open to all who wish to participate in one or more projects. There\u2019s always plenty to do \u2013 it\u2019s not all about programming. Translation, documentation, feedback, discussions, testing \u2013 all this is also important for projects so everyone is cordially invited to attend the codesprints! Registration with the conference is not a prerequisite for participation in the codesprint, the codesprint is *free of charge*.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The Codesprint Organizing Team is looking forward to your coming!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you have questions\/comments\/ideas please let us know, contacting the <a href=\"https:\/\/foss4g.asia\/2018\/contacts\/\">conference secretariat<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Participants can register for Code Sprint\u00a0from the venue.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FOSS4G Asia 2018 organizes a FOSS4G community sprint &nbsp; Join the\u00a0OSGeo\u00a0tribes and enjoy this friendly and interactive coding session.
