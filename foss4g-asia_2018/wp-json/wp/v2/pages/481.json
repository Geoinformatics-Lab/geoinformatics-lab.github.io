Hastings Award for exceptional contributions to the FOSS4G Community in Asia<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The FOSS4G-Asia 2018 organizing committee is proud to announce the inaugural David A. Hastings Award for exceptional contributions to the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G) community in Asia.\u00a0 Recipients may have helped spread FOSS4G in academia, promoted the use of FOSS4G in projects in Asia, or also helped translate front-end FOSS4G tools in local languages.<\/p>\n<p>David was an early influence on FOSS4G, having written a GRASS GIS Howto , as well as being heavily involved in the first FOSS4G event at Chula University in Bangkok Thailand in 2004, where he helped bring the future founders of the annual FOSS4G event Venkatesh Raghavan, Markus Neteler, and Jeff McKenna together; indeed they shared many laughs and stories on that special trip together.\u00a0 He also led an \u201cInstallfest\u201d at that FOSS4G 2004 event, which set the tone for so many future events.<\/p>\n<p>David would later go on to study at the global level a measurement of human development and happiness, what he coined as the Human Security Index.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. David A. Hastings unfortunately left us for his heavenly abode on the 13<sup>th<\/sup> of November, 2017.\u00a0 He leaves behind wonderful memories and deep sense of appreciation with all his friends and colleagues. David is survived by his gracious wife his son currently residing in Colorado, USA. He will be missed for his wisdom and wit and his contributions long remembered.<\/p>\n<p>The award will be presented in the closing plenary of the FOSS4G-Asia event at the University of Moratuwa on 5<sup>th<\/sup> December 2018.\u00a0 The hope is that this award helps share David\u2019s passion for helping the people of Asia now and into the future.<\/p>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large; color: #333333;\">The\u00a0organizing committee\u00a0is\u00a0<b>requesting nominations<\/b>\u00a0\u00a0for the\u00a0<b>David A.
