Authors illustrate their study findings by displaying graphs, photos, diagrams, and a small amount of text on poster boards.\u00a0In presenting your research with a poster, you should aim to use the poster as a means for generating <strong>active discussion<\/strong> of the research.\u00a0Poster sessions are a valuable opportunity for authors to present papers and meet with <strong>interested attendees for in-depth technical discussions<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Poster sessions are scheduled for <strong>90\u00a0minutes<\/strong>. Location will update soon.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Preparing your poster<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The poster must be\u00a0<strong>A0 size<\/strong>\u00a0(A0 size is 841mm x 1189mm) in\u00a0<strong>portrait\u00a0orientation<\/strong>. The <strong>title<\/strong> should be the same as in the submitted abstract. Display <strong>poster ID<\/strong> long with the authors Name\u00a0(Note: Poster ID will be available on the conference website on 25th November, 2018).<\/p>\n<p>The poster should be <strong>easily readable<\/strong> at a distance of two metres. Use UPPER and lower case for general content as the use of all-capital text is difficult to read. Avoid using a mixture of type\/font styles.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'CG Times', 'Times New Roman';\"><strong>Simplicity<\/strong> is the key. Keep to the point, and don&#8217;t try to cover too many things. Present only enough data to support your conclusions. On the other hand, make sure that you present sufficient data to support your conclusions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Presenting authors <strong>should print their physical poster<\/strong> based on the requirements listed in the sections above. FOSS4G Asia 2018 Conference does not print posters on behalf of presenters.<\/p>\n<p>Authors <strong>may bring additional written material<\/strong> of a non commercial nature that supplements the material presented on the poster. Business cards is a great networking opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>QR Codes (optional). FOSS4G Asia 2018 is promoting the idea of QR Codes for authors to incorporate into their posters. This would allow you to add a barcode readable by smartphones. The barcode can be designed to link the person viewing your poster to a related video, your website, or your contact information.<\/p>\n<p>Computers without audio may be used to run demonstrations and display additional information or illustrations. No electrical outlets will be provided @ poster session area. Please come with <strong>your computer charged<\/strong>!, if you want to use in the poster session<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Poster Setup Information<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ol style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #000000;\" type=\"1\">\n<li>Poster authors can set-up their posters <strong><u>before 30min<\/u><\/strong> on the day of their poster session.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Poster numbers<\/strong> will be posted on the poster boards in numerical order; please find your paper number and post your poster in the designated space.<\/li>\n<li>FOSS4G Asia 2018\u00a0provides a <strong>display board<\/strong> and <strong>thumbtacks<\/strong> for presenters to use to attach posters made of paper or lightweight poster board.
